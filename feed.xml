&lt;p&gt;Liquidation is an original Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game set in a universe that mixes elements of both fantasy and science fiction, with support for both single-player and multiplayer modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game takes place in the dying plane of Veá, which has been repeatedly ravaged and drained of its very life essence over the course of a massive war that has been going on for centuries. Now, with the doomed world drawing its last breath, you arise as a lesser deity tasked with restoring the balance in Veá and ending this war before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

Will you even follow your task, or will you be the instrument that brings about Veá’s fateful end?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">LIQUIDATION is a fantasy/sci-fi singleplayer and multiplayer real-time strategy game with rpg elements in which you take the role of a Deity to bring back balance to the devastated and war-torn world of Veá.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://puppetsbunker.com/img/liquidation.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://puppetsbunker.com/img/liquidation.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
